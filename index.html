            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Michael J. Romero, a recent graduate at California State University East Bay (CSU East Bay) with 
                a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science (B.S. in CS). I am seeking challenging opportunities to further hone my 
                problem-solving abilities, technical expertise, and leadership skills within a dynamic professional environment. I am eager 
                to bring my enthusiasm, dedication, and strong work ethic to contribute meaningfully and achieve tangible results within the tech world.</p>

            <p>I'm an aspiring Machine Learning (ML) enthusiast with a keen interest in Cybersecurity. I believe in the potential of ML to 
                revolutionize our Cybersecurity space by identifying patterns of malicious threats and adapting to new attack vulnerabilities.
                Beyond Cybersecurity, ML is also capable of diagnosing diseases through image analysis and processing data from sensors and cameras, 
                enabling vehicles to navigate safely in self-driving assistance.</p>

            <p>Throughout my college career, I've engaged in a diverse range of coursework projects. These have included writing SQL scripts to design and create 
                databases, developing Python code in Jupyter Notebook for neural network modeling that can learn XOR gates using backpropagation learning algorithms.
                Additionally, I have gained hands-on experience in cybersecurity and information assurance. I applied these concepts in real-world scenarios, such as 
                capturing and analyzing encrypted and unencrypted network traffic using Wireshark, performing brute-force password attacks on Secure Shell (SSH) using 
                Hydra, and illustrating network mapping of devices, services, and connections on a network through tools like Nmap, Zenmap, and Wireshark.</p>

            <p>Feel free to explore my growing portfolio, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or connect about other aspirations 
                in the ever-evolving field of technology!</p>

                    <p>Worked under my mentor Dr. Antoine Iselgren-Wojdyla, who is a research scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National
                        Laboratory (LBNL) Advanced Light Source (ALS) Division. We experimented with a new scheme that allows the
                        control of scientific instruments over Ethernet with EPICS (Experience Physics Industrial Control System) and a
                        series of Raspberry Piâ€™s via various operating systems (OS) to demonstrate that instrument controls can be distributed.</p>
        
                    <p>We concluded that combining EPICS, Raspberry Pi 5, and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS effectively creates a robust distributed network.
                        Developed comprehensive doccumentation to aid future deployments. Establishing the integration of environmental sensors 
                        and the potential to control experiments where various instruments work together seamlessly, paving the way for complex 
                        autonomous experiments.</p>
